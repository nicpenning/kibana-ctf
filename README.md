Kibana CTF is an open source Kibana CTF challenge simulation using the open source product [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) and the Elastic stack. This project is designed to modularize challenges so new challenges can be add in the future. To date, there are 15 challenges. This project includes a script as you will see below that allows you to create a local CTFd instance and a local Elastic stack for trying out this CTF! In theory, the script can be used to import the challenges into your own CTFd instance or Elastic instance, but be warned that it could overwrite or cause undesired consequences to those instances if not careful. It is recommended that you use the script to spin up a unique localized instance using Docker and the steps below to perform this CTF. Please open any issues that you may find. Enjoy!

Goal: Try to complete all 15 challenges within 1 hour.

üé∂ Here is a Spotify playlist that works great as a motivator and timer!

```
 ./Invoke-Kibana-CTF-Setup.ps1                                                                                                       
Welcome to the Kibana CTF Setup Script!
What would you like to do?
1. Deploy CTFd
2. Deploy Elastic Stack
3. Import Flags (CTFd) + Challenges (Elastic Stack)
4. Delete CTFd
5. Delete Elastic Stack
6. Check for Requirements
7. Deploy everything from scratch (Recommended - Performs Options 1, 2 & 3 in sequence)

Q. Quit
Enter your choice: 7
```

## How to get started ‚úÖ
### 1. Ensure you have PowerShell 7+ installed then download this repo to get rolling!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicpenning/kibana-ctf.git
cd kibana-ctf
pwsh
./Invoke-Kibana-CTF-Setup.ps1
```

_Note: Run Option 6. Check for Requirements, then proceed to the next step if your environment meets the requirements._

### 2. Deploy everything from scratch - Use Option 7
   <details>
    a. Once deployed, go to the CTFd instance and navigate through the wizard with default settings (most of these will be overwritten later). Make sure to make note of your admin user/password combination and specify how long you want the CTF to last (this can easily be changed later if needed.)

   ![CTFd First Start Page](./images/image.png)
   ![Step 2 Sample](./images/image-1.png)
   ![Step 3 Sample](./images/image-2.png)
   ![Step 4 Sample](./images/image-4.png)
   ![Step 5 Sample](./images/image-5.png)
   ![Step 6 - Set Start / End Date of Challenge](./images/image-6.png)
   ![Finish!](./images/image-7.png)

    b. Go to settings, create the API Access Token and copy for later since you will not be able to see them after dismissing that pop up window. (No worries if you forget, you can create one later.)

   ![API Access Token](./images/image-8.png)
   ![Navigate to Access Token Page](./images/image-9.png)
   ![Generate Token](./images/image-10.png)
   ![Copy Token for Usage Later](./images/image-11.png)
   </details>
   
### 3. Login to Kibana!
Go to the Kibana CTF space and be ready to start the CTF using the provided credentials from the setup:
```
user: kibana-ctf
password: kibana-ctf--please-change-me
```
Now you need to create your CTFd user for completing the challenges. Open up CTFd and sign out of the admin account you created before and register your Kibana CTF user by going here: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/register](http://127.0.0.1:8000/register). Once that user is created and is logged into, you now have both the CTFd and Kibana users ready to fully participate in the CTF. Spin up üé∂ Spotify in an [extra tab](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Rax5ahJdZkq1xrgkqDqTX?si=ce0c2f33bb8c43d0), hit play, then good luck and have fun! üöÄ

## Modular Challenge Structure üèóÔ∏è
Challenges are stored in the `challenges` and each challenge is part of a category and contains files necessary to build the challenge in CTFd and the populate the challenge in the Elastic stack. Don't look at this files if you wish to challenge yourself! These challenges are modular so more can be added later or tweaked as needed. Inside of the challenges directory, there are files as follows:

```
Discover/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (Challenge Number)/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ctfd_challenge.md ---> This is the shell of the challenge that includes the name, description, value, etc. which will be stored in CTFd. (Required)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ctfd_flag.json ---> This is the actual flag used in CTFd. (Required)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ctfd_hint.json ---> This is the hint for the challenge in CTFd. (Optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elastic_import_script.ps1 ---> This is a specialized PowerShell script used to create the contents for a challenge. (Optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ elastic_saved_objects.json ---> These are the saved objects that are imported into the Elastic stack for the challenge. (Optional)
```

## Thank you üôè 
**Thank you** to all those who took the time to try this out, work out the bugs, and make it what it is today before the public release. You know who you are! **Thank you!**

Everyone else, feel free to give this CTF a go, submit issues as you find them and if you are bold enough, try your hand at creating your own challenge and share it with the community. Pull requests are most certainly welcome!

### Advanced Settings for CTFd access - Allow others on the network to access the CTF
Note: You can grab the Ubuntu IP by running this from your Ubuntu WSL2 host: `ip addr | grep eth0`:
```bash
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet **172.25.93.23**/20 brd 172.25.95.255 scope global eth0
25: veth06010d4@if24: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master br-765cf15dc8a1 state UP group default
```

Then from Powershell you can set up a port proxy to allow traffic to your system that is hosting the CTF and direct those to your internal setup by running this command (make sure to adjust to your IP addresses accordingly):
```Powershell
$local_IP = "192.168.86.90" # Replace this with your local IP address
$wsl2_IP = "172.25.93.23" # Replace this with your WSL2 IP address - See example above on how to obtain this
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=31337 listenaddress=$local_IP connectport=8000 connectaddress=$wsl2_IP
```
Doing the step above then allows access to your computer from http://192.168.86.90:31337 since it will forward any traffic from other devices to the WSL2 IP of 172.25.93.24:8000 (which you can access locally). 

‚ö†Ô∏è Just becareful not to do this on public networks. Do this at your own risk.üî•

If you have a Windows Firewall enabled, you will need to allow the port used above (ie TCP 31337).
